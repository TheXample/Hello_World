# Welcome back wonder baby. This time around well see two different ways to distinguish between inputs.
# First up well need an input. We learned how that works in the last task so your first quest is to make a variable and store the input there.


# Wonderful! Now we'll see the first thing we can do with our if. We want to make it so the program stopps when the User says "stop" or "Stop".
# So we'll need to check if our input variable is one of those two. 
# To do that we use the equals again from task 1.2 and behind that another equals and separate them with an "OR".
# Now if eather of those statements is correct it will do what is indented behind it.


# Now we want to make a little Menu. so if the user pressed the 1 it says hello. If the user pressed 2 it says Bye.
# We can do that by using the "elif" (else if) function.
