# Hi again baby, well now make your hello call a little more secure by adding a password.

# Imagine this being your super hero computer, first you need to think of a password and write in the line underneath to remember it.
# myPassword: 

# Then well use a variable to safe it for your computer. 
# We do that by finding a name for it and then writing it like this: name = value
# Now its your turn in the line underneath you can put your variable with your password.


# Okay now well make another variable for the input just the way we did the other one underneath here.


# Great! Now we need a way to compare those two passwords. We'll do that by using the "if" methode.
# You have seen how to use a methode in the last task so now well do it again. 
# An "if" gets a statement, and if that statement is true it'll do the things that are indented after it, if not itll not.
# As a statement you have "<,>,==,!=" choose your fighter!
# Write your if in the line underneath


# Alright we have made it to here now we just need to hit tab once to make sure the code will only be started if our statement is true.
